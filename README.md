This repository holds the code for implementing the method presented in the paper [US-LIME: Increasing fidelity in LIME using uncertainty sampling on tabular data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2024.127969).

US-LIME: Uncertainty-Sampling LIME is an extended version of [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) that filters the sampling strategy to gain more fidelity.
